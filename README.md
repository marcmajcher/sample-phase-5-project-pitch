# Sweet Project Title

This is the part where I tell you about the project. The "pitch", if you will. I'm giving you a high level overview of what the project does, and why I decided to build it. This doesn't have to be extensive, just a quick overview.

This is the repo for, say, the frontend of the app. It's hosted [here](http://some.hosting.service/myapp) and the backend repo is [here](http://github.com/itsame/myapp-backend).

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so I can log in and use the app.
* As a user, I want to be able to see my user info, so etc etc etc
* As an editor, I want to be able to do an admin thing, so I can etc etc

(Have one story for each feature you plan to includeâ€”even small features are great to list here, so feel free to get granular with it. You'll probably be making a new branch for each of these, right?)

## Models and Relationships

This is a good place for a sweet diagram:

### User

A `User` has many `Pickles`, and so on and so forth

* id
* username
* password_digest
* firstname
* lastname
* birthday
* favorite color

### Pickle

A `Pickle` belongs to a `User`, and so on 

* id
* variety
* weight
* price
* description

## API

Here's where you want to describe each API endpoint you're building/using. You can put this in your front end repo, your back end repo, or both.

### GET /api/users

Returns a list of all users. Response JSON looks like this:

```json
{ 
  id: 111,
  username: "johndoe",
  firstname: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  etc: "etc"
}
```

### POST /api/users

Creates a new user. Say more about that here. Send this data:

```json
{ this is what it takes as data }
```

And this is what it returns:

```json
{ this is what you get back }
```

## Wireframe / Mockup

Put your sweet wireframes and mockup images here. Probably only goes in the front end repo.
